# This is a Django management command for dumping data from 'Product' model of 'shopapp' app
# This command will output a JSON representation of all instances of the specified model (shopapp.Product in this case)
# The output is redirected to a JSON file named 'shopapp-products-fixtures.json' inside the project directory

# json:
python manage.py dumpdata shopapp.Product > shopapp-products-fixtures.json

# xml:
python manage.py dumpdata --formt xml shopapp.Product > shopapp-products-fixtures.xml

# The loaddata command is used here to load data from the 'shopapp-products-fixtures.json'
# file into the database. This is especially useful when you want to populate your database
# with some pre-existing data. These operations are important when you want to backup your data
# or move data between environments (like from development to production or vice-versa).

# The loaddata command:
python manage.py loaddata shopapp-products-fixtures.json


# for devices.csv
